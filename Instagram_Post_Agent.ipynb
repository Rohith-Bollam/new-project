            "*   **Engagement:**  Be responsive to comments and messages.  Answer questions, provide encouragement, and build a community around your content.\n",

For example, instead of just \"paying off student loans,\" maybe:  \"I used to stress about tuition... now I'm saving for a spring break trip *and* making a dent in my textbook costs!\"  This makes it *hyper-relevant* to immediate student concerns.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **Etsy - Startup Cost Awareness:**  Acknowledge the potential (small) startup costs associated with Etsy.  You could say: \"✨ Create and sell unique jewelry, digital art prints, or cozy knitwear online.  *Note: Etsy may have small listing fees.* Perfect for expressing your creativity and earning extra cash.\" This shows transparency.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Link in Bio Teaser:**  Consider mentioning *specifically* what they'll find when they click the link in bio.  For example: \"Tap the link in bio for our *free guide to landing your first side hustle – including templates and resources!* 🔗\"  The more specific, the better.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Hashtag Optimization:** Consider adding a location-specific hashtag like `#AustinStudents` or `#TexasUniversity` to target local students.  However, be mindful of overdoing it.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Emoji Refinement:** While emojis are great, too many can be distracting. Ensure they enhance the message rather than detract from it. Review the emojis again to ensure each one adds value.\n",
